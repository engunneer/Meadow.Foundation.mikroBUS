# Meadow.Foundation.mikroBUS.Displays.C16x9

**MikroElectronika I2C 16x9 Click LED board**

The **C16x9** library is included in the **Meadow.Foundation.mikroBUS.Displays.C16x9** nuget package and is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform.

This driver is part of the [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/) peripherals library, an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT applications.

## Installation

You can install the library from within Visual studio using the the NuGet Package Manager or from the command line using the .NET CLI:

`dotnet add package Meadow.Foundation.mikroBUS.Displays.C16x9`
## Usage

```csharp
readonly C16x9 c16x9;

public MeadowApp()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Initializing ...");

    c16x9 = new C16x9(Device.Pins.D14, Device.CreateI2cBus(Meadow.Hardware.I2cBusSpeed.Standard));
    c16x9.IgnoreOutOfBoundsPixels = true;

    c16x9.Clear();

    var graphics = new MicroGraphics(c16x9)
    {
        Rotation = RotationType._180Degrees
    };
    graphics.CurrentFont = new Font4x8();

    var message = "Wilderness Labs Meadow F7 Feather";

    while (true)
    {
        for (int x = 0; x < message.Length * 4; x++)
        {
            graphics.Clear();
            graphics.DrawText(0 - x, 1, message);
            graphics.Show();
        }
    }
}
