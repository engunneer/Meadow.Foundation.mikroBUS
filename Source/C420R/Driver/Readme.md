# Meadow.Foundation.mikroBUS.Sensors.C420R

**MikroElectronika SPI 4-20mA Receiver click board**

The **C420R** library is designed for the [Wilderness Labs](www.wildernesslabs.co) Meadow .NET IoT platform and is part of [Meadow.Foundation](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/).

The **Meadow.Foundation** peripherals library is an open-source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your C# .NET Meadow IoT application.

## Usage

```csharp
private C420R receiver;

public override Task Initialize()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Initializing ...");

    receiver = new C420R(Device.CreateSpiBus(), Device.Pins.D00);

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

public override async Task Run()
{
    while (true)
    {
        var r = await receiver.Read();
        Resolver.Log.Info($"Reading: {r.Milliamps:0.00} mA");
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
